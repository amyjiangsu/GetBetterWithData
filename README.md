# GetBetterWithData
Hackathon on Nov. 7, 2015

### Problem
As addressed in Fred's presentation "Why is it so hard to get healthcare information that matters?", one of the big barriers for consumers to get quality health care in America is due to the lack of transparency of cost and quality data of the medical care service.  The goal of our predictive model is to predict the medical care cost in answer to a specific user query on age, gender, race, type of admission, disease, procedure, medical/surgical description, patient disposition and source of payment.           

### Solution
We brainstormed and experimented different models and analysis.   However, due to the time limit, we finally chose to employ a regularized lasso regression model  in the final data product.

Tools for exploratory analysis and data visualization: Python, GoogleVis
Tools for model building: Python, R
